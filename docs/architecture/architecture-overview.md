# OCOS Web3 Dashboard – Architecture Overview

## 1. Introduction

This document presents a comprehensive overview of the OCOS Web3 Dashboard architecture. The system is designed for modularity, scalability, security, and seamless blockchain integration, supporting a multi-language and multi-chain environment.

---

## 2. High-Level Architecture

The OCOS Web3 Dashboard is built on a modern web stack, including:

- **Frontend:** React.js (Next.js compatible), Tailwind CSS, Web3.js/Ethers.js, i18n
- **Backend (optional):** Node.js/Express, MongoDB/PostgreSQL, REST/WebSocket
- **Smart Contracts:** OCOS Token (ERC-20/BEP-20), Staking, Airdrop, Upgradeable modules
- **Blockchain:** Binance Smart Chain (BSC) primary, with future Ethereum & Polygon support
- **APIs/Oracles:** PancakeSwap, Chainlink, BSCScan, and third-party integrations

---

## 3. Main Components

### a. **Frontend**
- Wallet connection (MetaMask, Trust Wallet, WalletConnect)
- Real-time price, liquidity, and staking dashboards
- User airdrop, claim, and transaction history modules
- Responsive and animated UI with dark/light themes
- Multi-language support (AZ, EN, TR)

### b. **Backend (optional)**
- API aggregation for price and analytics
- User profile and preferences (if required)
- Staking/airdrop eligibility checks
- Admin analytics and log processing

### c. **Smart Contracts**
- OCOS Token contract (ERC-20/BEP-20)
- Staking contract with flexible reward mechanics
- Airdrop contract for fair and transparent distribution
- Upgradeable contract patterns for future-proofing

### d. **Oracles & External APIs**
- **Chainlink:** Reliable, decentralized price feeds (BNB/USD, etc.)
- **PancakeSwap API:** Live token price, liquidity pool data
- **BSCScan:** Transaction and contract analytics
- **Social/Community:** Telegram/Twitter/Discord widgets (optional)

## 4. Data Flow

1. **User connects wallet:**  
   - Authenticates via MetaMask/Trust Wallet/WalletConnect
2. **Frontend loads live data:**  
   - Fetches real-time price, pool, and user data from APIs and blockchain
3. **Smart contract interactions:**  
   - All critical actions (stake, claim, swap) are signed and sent on-chain by user
4. **Backend processes analytics (if used):**  
   - Aggregates user stats, staking/airdrop logs, admin insights
5. **Frontend updates UI:**  
   - Shows real-time feedback, balances, rewards, and notifications

---

## 5. Security Considerations

- No private key or sensitive data stored
- All transactions require explicit wallet signature
- Anti-phishing, XSS protections in frontend
- Regular smart contract audits and bug bounties
- Client-side only for all critical actions (non-custodial)

---

## 6. Scalability & Extensibility

- Modular component-based frontend (React)
- RESTful and WebSocket APIs for extensibility
- Multi-chain & multi-wallet support designed from day one
- Easy addition of modules: NFT, Launchpad, DAO, Governance
