# Production Best Practices

This document outlines best practices for deploying and maintaining the OCOS Web3 Dashboard (or any modern dApp) in a production environment. Following these guidelines will help ensure reliability, performance, and security for your users and your infrastructure.

## 1. Secure Environment Configuration

- **Never commit secrets**: Keep API keys, RPC endpoints, and private keys out of your codebase. Use environment variables and secret management services.
- **.env files**: Restrict permissions; never expose `.env` to public repositories.
- **Rotate credentials** regularly and monitor for accidental leaks.

## 2. HTTPS and Domain Security

- Always enable HTTPS. Use SSL certificates from a reputable provider (e.g., Let's Encrypt).
- Redirect all HTTP traffic to HTTPS.
- Set HTTP security headers (HSTS, Content-Security-Policy, X-Frame-Options).

## 3. Frontend Optimization

- Enable code splitting and lazy loading to minimize bundle size.
- Use caching (service workers, CDN) for static assets.
- Minify CSS/JS, optimize images, and enable GZIP/Brotli compression.

## 4. Backend & API Security

- **Rate limiting**: Prevent abuse by limiting API requests per IP/user.
- **CORS configuration**: Only allow trusted domains.
- **Input validation**: Sanitize and validate all incoming data.
- **Logging & monitoring**: Log errors and key events. Use monitoring tools (Sentry, Datadog, etc.).

## 5. Blockchain Integration

- Always use HTTPS RPC endpoints.
- Monitor smart contract events for suspicious activities.
- Never expose private keys or mnemonics in the frontend/backend.
- Validate and verify contract addresses before interacting.

## 6. Continuous Integration/Deployment (CI/CD)

- Use automated CI/CD pipelines for testing, linting, and deploying code.
- Require PR approvals and enforce code review.
- Test on mainnet/testnet before every major release.

## 7. Uptime & Health Monitoring

- Use uptime monitoring services (e.g., UptimeRobot, Pingdom) for your dashboard and API.
- Set up alerts for downtime or critical errors.
- Regularly review logs and analytics.

## 8. User Security

- Never store user private keys or mnemonicsâ€”use client-side wallet integrations (MetaMask, WalletConnect, etc.).
- Display clear transaction and security warnings.
- Use anti-phishing banners and verify your domain with users.

## 9. Data Privacy & Compliance

- Comply with GDPR or other local data privacy regulations.
- Clearly inform users about data collection, cookies, and analytics.
- Allow users to opt out of analytics if required by law.

## 10. Backups & Disaster Recovery

- Regularly back up databases, server configs, and other critical data.
- Test your backup and restore procedures periodically.
- Have a rollback plan for failed deployments.

## 11. Performance & Scaling

- Use global CDNs for static content delivery.
- Scale backend services horizontally as needed.
- Optimize database queries and leverage caching.

## 12. Documentation

- Maintain up-to-date deployment and operation documentation.
- Document incident response procedures and escalation paths.
- Provide clear user guides and FAQs.

## 13. Smart Contract Safety

- Only interact with audited smart contracts.
- Monitor for new vulnerabilities (subscribe to security mailing lists).
- Prepare for emergency upgrade/patch scenarios.
