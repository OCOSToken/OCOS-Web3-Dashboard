# Security Overview

## Introduction

Security is a top priority for the OCOS Web3 Dashboard. This document outlines the principles, practices, and architecture decisions that ensure platform resilience, user protection, and compliance with the highest standards in Web3 and FinTech.

---

## Core Security Principles

- **Minimized Trust:** The platform minimizes trust by relying on user-owned wallets and on-chain verification. No sensitive data or private keys are ever stored on our servers or in local storage.
- **End-to-End Encryption:** Communication between user browsers, backend (if used), and third-party APIs is always encrypted via HTTPS/TLS.
- **Least Privilege:** Smart contracts, API keys, and internal services are configured with the least privilege required to function.
- **Transparency:** All contracts and key integrations are open-source and verifiable on public block explorers and GitHub.

## Platform Security Features

### 1. Wallet & Authentication

- **Non-Custodial:** OCOS never holds user funds or private keys.
- **SIWE (Sign-In With Ethereum) Supported:** Secure authentication using wallet signatures.
- **No Passwords:** Access control is managed through cryptographic signatures, not passwords.

### 2. Smart Contract Security

- **Audited Contracts:** All critical smart contracts are subject to third-party and internal audits.
- **Upgradeable Contracts:** Uses proxy patterns where needed, with transparent upgrade policies.
- **Open Source:** All contract code is public for community review.

### 3. Frontend Security

- **No Sensitive Storage:** No mnemonic/private key is ever stored in browser localStorage or cookies.
- **Web3 Anti-Phishing:** UI patterns discourage phishing and display verified contract addresses.
- **Input Validation:** All user inputs are strictly validated and sanitized to prevent XSS/Injection attacks.
- **Dependency Scanning:** Continuous automated scans for vulnerable npm packages.

### 4. Backend/API Security (if applicable)

- **Rate Limiting:** API endpoints are protected against DDoS by throttling.
- **IP Filtering & Logging:** Sensitive admin endpoints are IP-restricted and fully logged.
- **No User Secrets:** No custodial storage or processing of user secrets.

### 5. Infrastructure & DevOps

- **HTTPS Everywhere:** All platform endpoints enforce HTTPS.
- **Environment Segregation:** Development, staging, and production environments are fully isolated.
- **Key Rotation:** All secrets and API keys are rotated regularly and never hardcoded.
- **Automated Monitoring:** Continuous monitoring of uptime, error rates, and security events.

## Responsible Disclosure

If you discover a vulnerability or security issue, please report it **privately and responsibly** via email: [security@ocos.io](mailto:security@ocos.io).  
We will respond promptly and keep all reports confidential.

---

## Compliance & Best Practices

- **GDPR & Data Privacy:** Platform is designed to meet international privacy standards.
- **Open Audits:** Audit results are published and all issues transparently tracked.
- **Ongoing Penetration Testing:** Both internal and external pen-tests are performed regularly.
