# Responsible Disclosure Policy

## Introduction

OCOS is committed to ensuring the security and privacy of its users and community.  
We value the input of security researchers and the wider community in responsibly disclosing any vulnerabilities or weaknesses they may discover in our platform.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you believe you have discovered a security vulnerability in the OCOS Web3 Dashboard, smart contracts, APIs, or any associated services, we request that you disclose it responsibly by following these guidelines:

- **Contact:**  
  Send a detailed email to [security@ocos.io](mailto:security@ocos.io) or [info@ocos.io](mailto:info@ocos.io) with the following:
  - A clear description of the vulnerability, including the location, impact, and steps to reproduce.
  - Any proof-of-concept code or screenshots, if available.
  - Your contact information for follow-up.

- **Do Not:**  
  - Do not publicly disclose the vulnerability before we have addressed it.
  - Do not exploit the vulnerability beyond what is necessary to prove its existence.
  - Do not attempt to access, modify, or delete data that does not belong to you.

## Our Commitment

- We will acknowledge your report within 2 business days.
- We will investigate the issue promptly and keep you updated on our progress.
- We will work to fix validated vulnerabilities as quickly as possible, typically within 7â€“30 days depending on severity.
- We will publicly thank you for your responsible disclosure (unless you wish to remain anonymous).
- No legal action will be taken against researchers acting in good faith and within the guidelines of this policy.
