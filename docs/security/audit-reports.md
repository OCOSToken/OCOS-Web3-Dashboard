# Audit Reports

## Overview

OCOS Web3 Dashboard adheres to the highest security standards in the DeFi and Web3 industry. Regular independent security audits are conducted to ensure the integrity, reliability, and transparency of all smart contracts, APIs, and platform modules. This document provides a summary of completed, ongoing, and planned audits, along with key findings, mitigation steps, and references to detailed reports.

## 1. Security Audit Objectives

- Identify vulnerabilities in smart contracts and application logic
- Ensure compliance with industry best practices (e.g., OWASP, SWC Registry, DeFi protocols)
- Verify correctness of staking, airdrop, and liquidity modules
- Review third-party library usage and integration points
- Assess access control, signature handling, and upgradeability
- Provide actionable recommendations for risk mitigation
